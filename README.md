# about-me
Hi! Glad to see you here 😊 

I’m Ivy, a Business Analytics and Marketing student at Drexel University. I thrive where data meets storytelling, blending a human-centric approach with analytical rigor to uncover insights that drive impact in an ever-changing digital landscape.

My journey began in social media management and paid media advertising, but my curiosity quickly extended beyond launching campaigns to uncovering the story behind their performance. Having solved analytics challenges across e-commerce, fashion retail, and media agency environments, I’m excited to keep growing at the intersection of marketing and analytics!

Lately, I’m focusing on refining my analytics skills, exploring K-means clustering for smarter customer segments, and building out a consumer insight project to spot retention patterns.

When I’m not staring at numbers up and down, I play the ukulele 🎶, make fun little lattes 🍵, and stroll around museums and galleries 🏃🏻‍♀️
